# Quote Machine

In this project I practiced how to build a website using jQuery. I built a Quote Machine which gives you a quote and its author. I decided to make the app look very exciting and inspiring by changing background image every time you click next quote.

## Setup

Clone my repo and open index.html. It will open a tab in your browser or follow the link https://v-quote-machine.netlify.app.
